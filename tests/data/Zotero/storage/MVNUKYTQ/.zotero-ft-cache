Abstract

Structural studies of pentachromium and pentacobalt extended metal atom chain (EMAC) systems are presented in which the metal chains are helically wrapped by either the pentadentate dianion tripyridyldiamide (tpda) or its diethyl-substituted analogue bis(4-ethyl-2-pyridylamido)pyridine (etpda). The compound Cr 5 (tpda) 4 (NCS) 2 , ( 1 ) has alternating long and short Cr–Cr distances, contrary to recent reports that describe it as symmetrical with essentially equally spaced chromium atoms ( Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. , 1999, 1243; J. Phys. Chem. B , 2004, 108 , 959). The linear Cr 5 10+ chain is composed of two Cr 2 4+ quadruply bonded units and an isolated high spin Cr II unit. The new compounds Cr 5 (etpda) 4 Cl 2 ( 2 ), [Cr 5 (etpda) 4 FCl]PF 6 ( 3 ), and Co 5 (etpda) 4 (NCS) 2 ( 4 ) employ the etpda ligand as “insulation” around a central pentametal-atom “wire.” Compound 3 , like all other oxidized pentachromium compounds, has very disparate alternating short–long–short–long Cr–Cr distances, 2.032(3) Å, 2.560(6) Å, 1.873(5) Å, and 2.509(4) Å. Compound 4 shows a nearly uniform spacing of the Co atoms, although the outer Co–Co distances (2.279[4] Å) are slightly longer than the inner ones (2.239[4] Å).

    If you are not the author of this article and you wish to reproduce material from it in a third party non-RSC publication you must formally request permission using Copyright Clearance Center. Go to our Instructions for using Copyright Clearance Center page for details.

    Authors contributing to RSC publications (journal articles, books or book chapters) do not need to formally request permission to reproduce material contained in this article provided that the correct acknowledgement is given with the reproduced material.

    Reproduced material should be attributed as follows:
        For reproduction of material from NJC:
        Reproduced from Ref. XX with permission from the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) and The Royal Society of Chemistry.
        For reproduction of material from PCCP:
        Reproduced from Ref. XX with permission from the PCCP Owner Societies.
        For reproduction of material from PPS:
        Reproduced from Ref. XX with permission from the European Society for Photobiology, the European Photochemistry Association, and The Royal Society of Chemistry.
        For reproduction of material from all other RSC journals and books:
        Reproduced from Ref. XX with permission from The Royal Society of Chemistry.

    If the material has been adapted instead of reproduced from the original RSC publication "Reproduced from" can be substituted with "Adapted from".

    In all cases the Ref. XX is the XXth reference in the list of references.

    If you are the author of this article you do not need to formally request permission to reproduce figures, diagrams etc. contained in this article in third party publications or in a thesis or dissertation provided that the correct acknowledgement is given with the reproduced material.

    Reproduced material should be attributed as follows:
        For reproduction of material from NJC:
        [Original citation] - Reproduced by permission of The Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) on behalf of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) and the RSC
        For reproduction of material from PCCP:
        [Original citation] - Reproduced by permission of the PCCP Owner Societies
        For reproduction of material from PPS:
        [Original citation] - Reproduced by permission of The Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) on behalf of the European Society for Photobiology, the European Photochemistry Association, and RSC
        For reproduction of material from all other RSC journals:
        [Original citation] - Reproduced by permission of The Royal Society of Chemistry

    If you are the author of this article you still need to obtain permission to reproduce the whole article in a third party publication with the exception of reproduction of the whole article in a thesis or dissertation.
