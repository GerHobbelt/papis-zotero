Structural studies of pentachromium and pentacobalt extended metal atom chain (EMAC) systems are presented in which the metal chains are helically wrapped by either the pentadentate dianion tripyridyldiamide (tpda) or its diethyl-substituted analogue bis(4-ethyl-2-pyridylamido)pyridine (etpda). The compound Cr5(tpda)4(NCS)2, (1) has alternating long and short Cr–Cr distances, contrary to recent reports that describe it as symmetrical with essentially equally spaced chromium atoms (Eur. J. Inorg. Chem., 1999, 1243; J. Phys. Chem. B, 2004, 108, 959). The linear Cr510+ chain is composed of two Cr24+ quadruply bonded units and an isolated high spin CrII unit. The new compounds Cr5(etpda)4Cl2 (2), [Cr5(etpda)4FCl]PF6 (3), and Co5(etpda)4(NCS)2 (4) employ the etpda ligand as “insulation” around a central pentametal-atom “wire.” Compound 3, like all other oxidized pentachromium compounds, has very disparate alternating short–long–short–long Cr–Cr distances, 2.032(3) Å, 2.560(6) Å, 1.873(5) Å, and 2.509(4) Å. Compound 4 shows a nearly uniform spacing of the Co atoms, although the outer Co–Co distances (2.279[4] Å) are slightly longer than the inner ones (2.239[4] Å).

Introduction
Following a seductive and qualitatively simple idea that a metal wire might develop interesting and perhaps unpredictable properties when the dimensions are reduced from the millimeter to the nanometer scale,1 just as the electronic properties of spheres change when they are reduced from macroscopic to “quantum dot” size,2,3 it is tempting to synthesize and investigate the ultimately small “molecular wires,” namely those consisting of a linear chain of single metal atoms held in proximity by an “insulating” layer of surrounding polydentate ligands.
The chemistry of such extended metal atom chain (EMAC) complexes with polypyridylamido ligands has developed from trinuclear complexes4–8 to pentanuclear complexes9,10 to even longer chains.11 The key structural features are shown diagrammatically in Scheme 1 for M3(dpa)4X2 complexes, a (dpa = 2,2′-dipyridylamide, c), and M5(tpda)4X2 complexes, b (tpda = tripyridyldiamide, d).

The nature of the metal–metal bonding in these EMACs has been of interest to us12 and others13 because these compounds may find use in the context of molecular electronics,14 representing as they do the smallest possible analogue of a macroscopic wire: a chain of single metal atoms. However, study of EMACs has encountered several kinds of difficulties. For example, the ease with which the spacing of the metal atoms can change from one compound to another, and even from one crystalline form of the same compound to another, poses subtle crystallographic problems and is not easily accounted for by theory. Also, as synthetic efforts are extended to the isolation of longer EMACs, problems with stability and solubility become greater; thus the challenge of improving the properties of the ligands is presented. In response to the stability and solubility challenges, we have begun to explore the use of alkyl-substituted polypyridylamide ligands, such as the diethyl ligands shown in Scheme 1. A few EMACs wrapped by the depa (e)15 and etpda (f)1 ligands have been already described.
To elaborate on some of the structural difficulties which EMACs present, the smallest chains which contain trinuclear units display two distinct structural motifs: symmetrical or unsymmetrical (see Scheme 2). These can have very different physical properties as in Co3(dpa)4Cl2.16

Scheme 2
For Cr36+ species, unsymmetrical complexes are very common.17 These have two Cr atoms forming a short Cr–Cr quadruple bond while the third CrII ion remains unconnected to the Cr24+ unit and it is in a high spin state. We have shown18 that the pentachromium complex Cr5(tpda)4Cl2 (5) is similarly unsymmetrical as shown in Scheme 3, though another group has published an incorrect interpretation of the crystal structure of 5 which contains a symmetrical molecule having nearly equal Cr–Cr separations between all Cr atoms.19

Scheme 3

The misinterpretation19 arose because disorder of unsymmetrical molecules of 5 which point in opposite directions in the crystal was ignored. Since the X-ray diffraction data are only representative of the average atomic positions, the Cr atoms appear to be equally spaced. The displacement ellipsoids for the Cr atoms, however, are distinctly prolate and their major axes are parallel to the Cr–Cr bonds. This is a strong indicator of positional disorder of the metal atoms. When this disorder was taken into account,20 an unsymmetrical molecular structure was revealed for 5 consisting of two sets of Cr24+ quadruply bonded units and an additional CrII unit. The latter is high spin and responsible for the compound having four unpaired electrons.20
The structures of Cr5(tpda)4(NCS)2 (1)19 and a heptanuclear compound Cr7(teptra)4Cl2 (teptra = tetrapyridyltriamide)21 have also been published; the Cr–Cr spacings are reported to be roughly equal, but the Cr atoms again display unusually elongated displacement ellipsoids suggestive of the same type of disorder as seen for 5. More recently, a study was published on M3(dpa)4(NCS)2 and M5(tpda)4(NCS)2 complexes in which the compounds bind to the Au(111) surface through a terminal S-atom.22 A theoretical interpretation of the results, based on the assumption that the bound Cr3(dpa)4(NCS)2 and Cr5(tpda)4(NCS)2 (1) are symmetrical compounds having three-center, and five-center metal–metal bonds, respectively, was given.22
We have found that the description of Cr3(dpa)4(NCS)2 as a symmetrical molecule is inappropriate.17b Here, we report an alternative interpretation of 1 based on disordered Cr510+ chains which is in accord with our findings for 5. Although current evidence does not preclude the possibility of a change from the unsymmetrical structure of the solid state to a symmetrical one in solution or when bound to a gold surface, there is no evidence, nor any reason to believe that such a change occurs. We have also synthesized the ethylsubstituted compound Cr5(etpda)4Cl2 (2) but its crystal structure is highly disordered and will not be presented here. However, the oxidized complex [Cr5(etpda)4FCl]PF6 (3) has been structurally characterized and the disorder has been reliably modeled. Also reported is a related pentacobalt complex, Co5(etpda)4(NCS)2 (4), which can be compared to its tpda homologue, Co5(tpda)4(NCS)2 (6).9

Results and discussion
Compounds 1 and 2 were synthesized in useful yields by methods similar to those used for the synthesis of 518 from CrCl2 and Li2tpda or Li2etpda in refluxing THF. Dry KSCN was added to the reaction mixture for 1 in a forty-fold molar excess. X-ray quality crystals were grown by diffusion of hexanes into a CH2Cl2 solution for 1 and a CHCl3 solution for 2. Though the crystal structure of 2 presented major crystallographic difficulties which prevent bond distances from being reported here, both it and the structure of 1 revealed the familiar helical wrapping of the polypyridylamido ligands around

the pentachromium chain, with N-bonded thiocyanate ligands in each axial position for 1, having Cr–N distances of 2.237(6) and 2.214(6) Å. The Cr–NCS moiety is bent at the N atom with an angle of 155.0(5)°. These geometrical parameters are similar to those in the unsymmetrical trichromium complex Cr3(dpa)4(NCS)2 which has an average axial Cr–N bond length of 2.203[3] Å and a Cr–NC angle of 159.3[2]°.17b Similar to Cr3(dpa)4(NCS)2, 1 has unsymmetrical Cr–Cr separations as shown in Fig. 1. The Cr atom positions are disordered as in 5 and there are alternating long–short–long–short Cr–Cr distances which are given in Table 1 (which also lists the Cr–Cr distances for 5 and 3). These data show that 1 and 5 have much in common. They share the same general structure shown in Scheme 3, having rather short Cr–Cr distances (1.86–1.92 Å) for the inner (isolated) quadruple bond which is devoid of axial ligation, and somewhat longer distances (1.93–2.07 Å) for the outer quadruple bond which has one axial ligand (either Cl or NCS for 5 or 1, respectively). The other CrCr interatomic distances are quite long: 2.50–2.66 Å, consistent with the absence of a bond between these atoms.

It is instructive to compare this work to the previously reported structure of 1,19 in which all five Cr atoms and the NCS ligands are rigorously collinear with unusual Cr–NC angles of 180°, in contrast to the angles of ~155° seen in our structures of 1 and Cr3(dpa)4(NCS)2. The previous structure of 1 must necessarily suffer from severe disorder,19 since the molecule lies on a position of higher symmetry (4/m) than the molecule actually possesses, resulting in disorder of the left-handed and right-handed helices of the tpda ligands. As a result, many of the pyridyl rings in the previous structure are reported to be curiously non-planar, as seen very clearly in Fig. 2 of ref. 19. Also noticeable in this figure are the elongated thermal ellipsoids for the Cr atoms which are conspicuously prolate even though the ellipsoid plot is drawn at the meretriciously low 20% probability level. These unusual thermal parameters suggest that the Cr atoms are disordered as in our structure. Moreover, the reported Cr–Cr bond lengths of 2.24 and 2.25 Å are inconsistent with the data shown in Table 1. These anomalous structural features can also be obtained from our data if the disorder of the Cr5 chain is ignored. A thermal ellipsoid plot of the molecule so refined is given in Fig. 2. The Cr–Cr distances converge to values ranging from 2.17 to 2.35 Å and the displacement ellipsoids of the inner Cr atoms are distinctly prolate as shown in Fig. 2b. The prolate shape of the Cr ellipsoids closely resembles those in Fig. 2 of ref. 19. It should be noted that this refinement raises the wR2 index by 0.03. The similarities between 1 as refined without accounting for the disorder of the Cr atoms and the structure reported earlier19 supports the idea that both crystal structures are best described as having disordered unsymmetrical Cr510+ chains. We suggest that if the data

An enlargement of the thermal ellipsoids for the Cr and NCS atoms is shown in (b) with ellipsoids drawn at the 50% probability level to highlight the prolate shapes of Cr2, Cr3, and Cr4. Note the similarity of this figure to the plot of 1 shown in ref. 19. leading to the previously reported structure of 1 were refined with a model similar to ours, the refinement would improve, and the Cr–Cr distances will agree with those of the four independent structural determinations of the Cr510+ compounds listed in Table 1.
The Cr511+ compound [Cr5(etpda)4FCl]PF6 (3) is obtained in low yield by reaction of 2 with ferrocenium hexafluorophosphate. The structure, like that of all other known Cr511+ complexes, is distinctly unsymmetrical having short–long–short–long Cr–Cr distances of 2.032(3), 2.560(6), 1.873(5), and 2.509(4) Å as given in Table 1, with the five Cr atoms and the axial ligands residing on a crystallographic two-fold axis. A thermal ellipsoid plot of 3 is shown in Fig. 3. The axial fluoride anion, which must have been abstracted from a PF6 anion,23 is disordered along with all five of the Cr atoms, as shown in Fig. 3b.

but solutions decompose over a period of several days. There are two crystallographically independent molecules in the asymmetric unit, one of which is shown in Fig. 4. The two molecules are essentially identical, as shown in Table 2, where they are compared with each other and with the previously reported Co5(tpda)4(NCS)2 (6).9,24

As with the tpda analogue, the thiocyanate ligands in 4 are N-bonded to the terminal cobalt atoms. The Co5 chain, and in fact the entire SCN–Co5–NCS chain is essentially linear, although one of the NCS ions of each molecule is slightly misaligned with the Co5 chain. The key features of the structures of both molecules (Table 2) are similar although the Co–Co distances in 4 are, on average, 0.01 Å longer than those in 6.
The electrochemical results for 4 shown in Fig. 5 suggest the oxidation products will be a source of fruitful chemistry. The two reversible processes, at 0.178 V and 0.726 V imply that convenient chemical oxidants such as (C5H5)2FePF6 and AgPF6 should selectively accomplish the first and second oxidations of 4. It was found1 that in going from Ni5(tpda)4Cl2 to Ni5(etpda)4Cl2 the oxidation potential is shifted by 0.108 V. Presumably a similar effect should occur here, but only approximate potentials of 0.35 V and 0.85 V were reported23 for 6. On the basis of these figures, the shifts here are somewhat larger, viz., 0.17 V and 0.12 V, than in the nickel case.
Electronic structure considerations We take this opportunity to re-emphasize that because of the rodlike shapes of these EMACs and consequently the manner in which they pack in crystals, the experimental study of their structures demands careful attention to the possible occurrence of crystallographic disorder in the metal atom positions.

Cr–Cr bond distances in the pentachromium chains is large and unmistakable when the disorder is recognized and correctly taken into account in the refinement. However, when the structure solution is not adequately handled, the disorder can be overlooked and seemingly acceptable R values obtained. This can set the stage for a serious misinterpretation22 of the electronic structure.
Therefore, the problems of disorder in the structures as described above are not just questions of how the molecular structure is to be described. They have serious implications concerning the fundamental description of the electronic structures of all compounds containing EMACs. For a hypothetical infinite metal atom chain, this problem was addressed by Peierls25 who found that a conducting state with equal metal–metal interactions is often unstable with respect to a charge density wave distortion,26 as shown in Scheme 4.

Scheme 4

Pentanuclear complexes are not required to behave in the same way since they consist of a relatively short metal atom chain and have axial coordination in the terminal metal atoms, and current evidence indicates that pentacobalt complexes do not behave in this way, but an analogy of Cr510+ compounds to the Peierls distortion25 is not unreasonable. We believe this sort of distortion is energetically favorable especially in pentachromium complexes due to the formation of two localized Cr–Cr quadruple bonds (i.e., the pairing of 16 electrons in bonding orbitals). The terminal CrII unit remains 5-coordinate and high spin. If Co510+ complexes were to become unsymmetrical, two Co–Co single bonds would result in the pairing of only four electrons in net bonding orbitals.
Peng has described the electronic structure of the Cr510+ compounds in terms of five-center Cr–Cr bonds and supports this idea with extended Hückel “qualitative calculations” (sic.) using the essentially evenly spaced (and incorrect) geometry from their crystal structure of 5.19 These results indicate that 5 and 1 should contain 2 unpaired electrons. Since these calculations were done using an inappropriate structural model, it would not be surprising if the results of the calculations were in error. This has been shown to be the case, as 5 has a reported eff value of 4.2 B corresponding to four unpaired electrons.20 This is consistent with the high-spin terminal CrII ion that occurs in our structural model. It would be expected to have a g value less than 2 and thus a eff value less than the spin-

only value, 4.90 B. In no way is the eff of 4.2 B consistent with the molecule having 2 unpaired electrons.
Thus, we have shown for the third time that Cr510+ complexes are unsymmetrical and exist with alternating short (quadruply bonded) and long interatomic distances with an isolated terminal high spin CrII ion responsible for the four unpaired electrons of the compound. On the other hand, Co510+ complexes appear to be genuinely symmetrical and presumably contain five-center Co–Co bonds.
Experimental section
Materials
Potassium tert-butoxide was purchased from Aldrich. Anhydrous CoCl2 and CrCl2 were purchased from Strem Chemicals, and were heated in Me3SiCl prior to use. Methyl-lithium (1.6 M in Et2O) was purchased from Acros. All solvents were dried and distilled under N2 by following standard procedures. The H2etpda ligand was prepared by a previously published method.1 Compound 1 was synthesized following a modified literature procedure using standard Schlenk techniques.18 KSCN was dried at >100 °C under vacuum overnight, and added to the reaction mixture in 40-fold excess. Crystals of 1·2.5CH2Cl2 were grown by diffusion of hexanes into a CH2Cl2 solution of 1.
Physical measurements
Elemental analyses were performed by Canadian Microanalytical Services in British Columbia, Canada. The IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin–Elmer 16PC FT-IR spectrophotometer using KBr pellets. The cyclic voltammogram of 4 (0.5 mM in CH2Cl2) was recorded on a CH Instruments electrochemical analyzer with Bun4NPF6 (0.1 M) electrolyte, Pt working and auxiliary electrodes, a Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and a scan rate of 100 mV s−1.
Cr5(etpda)4Cl2, 2. H2etpda (0.26 g, 0.80 mmol) was dissolved in 30 cm3 of THF. The solution was cooled in a dry ice bath, and 1.0 cm3 of 1.6 M CH3Li in ether (1.6 mmol) was added slowly. The mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature to give a yellow solution, which was then transferred by cannula to a reaction flask containing anhydrous CrCl2 (0.12 g, 1.0 mmol). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h, and then refluxed for 20 h giving a deep brown solid, which was filtered, washed with THF, and extracted with chloroform (2–8 cm3). These extracts were combined and layered with hexanes. After 1 week, deep brown crystals of Cr5(etpda)4Cl2·6CHCl3 had formed. Yield: 0.18 g, 46%.

[Cr5(etpda)4FCl]PF6, 3. To a mixture of 150 mg (0.1 mmol) of Cr5(etpda)4Cl2 and 39 mg (0.1 mmol) of Cp2FePF6 was added 15 cm3 of chloroform. The resulting dark brown solution was stirred for 2 h, and then layered with hexanes to give a clear brown solution. The solvent was removed under vacuum, the solid was washed with 5 cm3 of hexanes and redissolved in 10 cm3 of 1,2dichloroethane. This was filtered into a crystallization tube where it was layered with hexanes. After about two weeks, brown crystals of [Cr5(etpda)4ClF]PF6·6C2H4Cl2 formed from the solution in low yield.
Co5(etpda)4(NCS)2, 4. A 100 cm3 round-bottom flask was charged with anhydrous CoCl2 (0.162 g, 1.25 mmol), H2etpda (0.319 g, 1.00 mmol), and naphthalene (8 g). The mixture was heated to 190–195 °C for 30 min, and then solid NaSCN (0.810 g, 10.0 mmol) and n-butanol (5 cm3) were added; heating was continued until the n-butanol was completely evaporated. A solution of ButOK (0.225 g, 2.00 mmol) in 5 cm3 of n-butanol was then added dropwise. Heating was continued until the remaining n-butanol had evaporated completely. The mixture was allowed to cool to about 80 °C, and hexanes were used to wash out naphthalene (3 × 60 cm3). The remaining dark brown solid was extracted with toluene (2 × 8 cm3). The solution comprised of these extracts was layered

Crystallography
A suitable crystal of each compound was mounted on to the tip of a quartz fiber and transferred to the goniometer of a Bruker SMART 1000 CCD detector system. Initial unit cell parameters were obtained from SMART software.27 Data integration, correction for Lorentz and polarization effects, and final cell refinement were performed by SAINTPLUS,28 and the data were further corrected for absorption using the program SADABS.29 The structures were solved initially by direct methods and then completed by successive least squares refinement on F2 followed by difference Fourier synthesis using the SHELXL-97 program.30 The non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters with the

exception of disordered groups. All hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions and used for the final refinement cycle. The treatment of the disordered chromium atoms in 1 and 3 is essentially the same as we have described in our reports of 5.18,20 The disordered chromium atoms in each structure were refined successfully as two sets of differently oriented, superposed linear chains having the five metal atoms arranged in a short–long–short–long fashion. Restraints were applied on the chain geometry to make the minor orientation approximately equal to that of the major orientation in the opposite direction. Fractional occupancies of the major orientations were refined to 0.708(5) for 1 and 0.610(3) for 3, respectively. The disordered interstitial solvent molecules, namely CH2Cl2 in 1 and C2H4Cl2 in 3, were refined with constraints on the distances. Compound 4 crystallizes in a non-centrosymmetric space group Cc. Refinement of the structure showed interstitial toluene molecules. One is disordered in two positions and it has a total occupancy of ca. 0.5 and this value was fixed in the final structural refinement. This results in a total of two molecules of 4 and 3.5 toluene molecules in the asymmetric unit, and the formula for this compound is abbreviated as 4·1.75toluene. Additional refinement details are listed in Table 3 and selected bond distances and angles for 1, 3, and 4 are shown in Tables 4, 5, and 6, respectively.
