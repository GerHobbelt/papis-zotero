Abstract : This manual documents the use and simple customization of the display editor EMACS with the Twenex (Officially known as TOPS-20) operating system. The reader is not expected to be a programmer. Even simple customizations do not require programming skill, but the user who is not interested in customizing can ignore the scattered customization hints. This is primarily a reference manual, but can also be used as a primer. (Author)
